    ● Describe patterns you defined in Lisp-Miner in the report and justify the choice of the defined pattern (hypothesis) you are extracting.
    ● Attach the exported text file with the action rules you have extracted.
    ● Analyze a couple of the rules (with the best support) so that to suggest actions that should be taken for the chosen countries to change their status to less fragile.
